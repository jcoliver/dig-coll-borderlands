    "1. The title of the paper\n",
    "2. The words to look for\n",
    "3. The lanugage of the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these points warrant some discussion. If you just want to head to the code, go ahead and skip the points below. The comments in the code block indicate the changes to make before you execute the code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The title of the paper**. The paper we are going to look at is _El Tucsonense_, but we cannot just replace \"bisbee-daily-review\" with \"El Tucsonense\". This is because the data are organized in folders corresponding to, but not exactly the same as, the title of the paper. Each newspaper title has a corresponding folder named with (1) all lowercase letters and (2) dashes instead of spaces. So the data for _Bisbee Daily Review_ are in the folder \"bisbee-daily-review\" and the data for _El Tucsonense_ are in the folder \"el-tucsonense\". With this in mind, be sure to update the value for the title appropriately.\n",
    "2. **The words to look for**. This highlights how important it is that we consider the results of text data mining in the context of the language being analyzed. For convenience sake, we will still search for \"influenza\", and replace \"flu\" with \"gripe\" and \"gripa\". However, the latter two, gripe and gripa, are sometimes used colloquially in Mexico to refer to the common cold, and not just the influenza virus. So while we use these two terms in place of \"flu\", it warrants consideration that we may be analyzing the text data of _El Tucsonense_ differently than we did for the _Bisbee Daily Review_ data.\n",
    "3. **The lanugage of the paper**. Why is this step necessary? Did we not accommodate the language change by updating the search terms? Not entirely. When text data mining, one of the first steps is to remove words that are known as [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words). These are words that _generally_ contribute little meaning to the piece of text and we wish to ignore in analyses. In English, these include words like \"and\", \"I\", and \"the\"; Spanish stop words include \"y\", \"yo\", and \"la\". We set the language so that the stop words of the appropriate language are removed before analysis. It would not be appropriate to just remove all stop words of every language, because there is the very real possibility that the stop words of one language may actually be words of interest in another language (consider the \"yo\" of Spanish compared to the colloquial term \"yo\" in English which have a fairly different meaning, and the latter may be something we are interested in)."
